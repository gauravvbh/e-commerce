On this website, we have an authentication system for both admin and user roles. For the user interface, we use Material UI, and Razorpay is integrated as the payment gateway.

A user can register or log in to the website, after which they can explore all the available products. If they like a product, they can add it to the cart, adjust the quantity, and add multiple products simultaneously. During checkout, the user needs to provide their address and contact number, after which the order summary page will be displayed. The payment page will then open, where the user can select their preferred payment method and complete the transaction by entering the OTP. Upon successful payment, the order will be placed successfully.

In the admin panel, the admin can view the progress and details of all orders. The admin can also add or remove any products that have been published.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
